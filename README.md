## Inspiration

1. To create a decentralized music streaming service that is not controlled by any one entity and makes publishing and distributing music more transparent.
2. To create a service where fans can bet on their favourite artists and support them.
3. To provide artists tools to directly interact and reward their fans for their patronage in the form of airdrops.
4. To create a music streaming service that is more secure and resistant to censorship.


## What it does

Pixie is much more than just a marketplace for music nfts . The idea was to build a web3 spotify(?) but provide tools for artists to recognize their top patrons. Pixie sorts top patrons by their contributions to an artist and lets the artist interact with them in the form of airdrops/ private nft sales/ access to private events etc. This would not only help artists to monetize their content without any intermediary but also help fans get closer to the artists they love.

Pixie will serve the following three purposes:
1. Marketplace for music NFTs
2. Community builder for artists and their fans.
3. And obviously itâ€™s a music streaming service!


## How we built it
Backend is built using Hardhat, Solidity, OpenZepplin

Frontend uses NEXT, HTML CSS JavaScript

## What's next for Pixie

-Airdrop tools to distribute rewards among top fans

-Fractionalised nfts, to let more than one person  own that artist's music

-Tiered badges for fans with different utilities
