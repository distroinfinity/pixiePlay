The basic idea is to create a decentralized music streaming platform for Artists and all music lovers where

- each track is an NFT minted by the artist that wishes to publish his music and list it on the platform.
- The music NFT can further be traded on the platform where people can buy, sell and resell the music NFT and the original artist earns a royalty on every transaction.
- The platform also aims to aggregate fans for the artist that is the people who bought or traded their Music at any point in time.
- These NFT owners can also be rewarded by the artist in the form of airdrops, merch drops, free concert tickets
- and eventually, the owned music NFT can also act as tickets for their concert or access to some other special privileges if the artist wishes to do so.

The goal is to create an ecosystem for the music community where the artists are rewarded for their work in full and do not have to share any percentage of their earnings with any intermediary organisation like the labels or the existing music platform.Â 
Another advantage of this is the fans and the artist can connect directly with one another without having to have any intermediary organisation between them.

Essentially the platform will acts as

1. Music streaming service
2. Marketplace for music NFTs
3. Community builder for artists and their fans.
